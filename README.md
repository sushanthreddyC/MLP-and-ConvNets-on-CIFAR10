# MLP-and-ConvNets-on-CIFAR10

##Objectives:

1)To get hands-on experiences on working with images (CIFAR10) and neural networks by implementing multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets).
2)To test different regularization strategies to get the best performance out of your models.
3)To investigate the limitations of using MLPs in this task, compared with ConvNets.
4)To investigate the potential risk of fitting noise of both MLPs and ConvNets.
