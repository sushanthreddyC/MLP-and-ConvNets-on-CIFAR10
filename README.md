# MLP-and-ConvNets-on-CIFAR10

## Objectives:

- To get hands-on experiences on working with images (CIFAR10) and neural networks by implementing multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets).
- To test different regularization strategies to get the best performance out of your models.
- To investigate the limitations of using MLPs in this task, compared with ConvNets.
- To investigate the potential risk of fitting noise of both MLPs and ConvNets.
